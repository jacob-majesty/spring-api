### **Explanation of the Improved Diagram**

1. **Client (User)**:
   - The user initiates a request to access a secured resource (e.g., a web page or API endpoint).

2. **Security Filter Chain**:
   - The request passes through a series of filters that handle tasks like authentication, authorization, CSRF protection, and session management.

3. **AuthenticationManager**:
   - The central component responsible for authenticating the user. It delegates the authentication process to one or more `AuthenticationProvider`s.

4. **AuthenticationProvider**:
   - Performs the actual authentication logic (e.g., checking username/password against a database or LDAP server).

5. **UserDetailsService**:
   - Retrieves user-specific data (e.g., username, password, roles) from a data source (e.g., database, in-memory store).

6. **SecurityContext**:
   - Stores the details of the authenticated user (e.g., roles, permissions) for the duration of the request.

7. **AccessDecisionManager**:
   - Decides whether the authenticated user is authorized to access the requested resource based on roles, permissions, or other criteria.

8. **Secured Resource**:
   - The actual resource (e.g., a REST endpoint or web page) that the user is trying to access.

9. **Logout Handling**:
   - Handles user logout by invalidating the session and clearing the `SecurityContext`.

10. **Exception Handling**:
    - Handles security-related exceptions (e.g., redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page or returning an access-denied response).

11. **Access Denied**:
    - If the user is not authorized, they are redirected to an access-denied page or receive an error response.

### **Key Workflow**
1. The user sends a request to access a secured resource.
2. The request passes through the **Security Filter Chain**, where it is processed by various filters.
3. The **AuthenticationManager** authenticates the user by delegating to the appropriate **AuthenticationProvider**.
4. The **UserDetailsService** retrieves user details (e.g., from a database).
5. If authentication is successful, the `Authentication` object is stored in the **SecurityContext**.
6. The **AccessDecisionManager** checks if the user is authorized to access the requested resource.
7. If authorized, the user accesses the secured resource; otherwise, they are redirected to an access-denied page or receive an error response.
8. On logout, the session is invalidated, and the `SecurityContext` is cleared.
